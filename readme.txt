**About Hafez**
Hafez, whose full name is Shams-ud-Din Muhammad Hafez, was a 14th-century Persian poet renowned for his mystical and lyrically beautiful poetry. Born in Shiraz, Iran, Hafez is often referred to as the "Tongue of the Hidden" due to his ability to convey deep spiritual and philosophical insights through his verses. His poetry, collected in the Divan-e-Hafez, remains an enduring treasure of Persian literature and Sufi mysticism. Hafez's works explore themes of love, spirituality, fate, and the human condition, and his ghazals (lyric poems) continue to inspire and resonate with people around the world, transcending time and culture.
